# WoW Raidbuilder

A SQL-based website designed for users of the video game 'World of Warcraft' to help guild leaders manage 'raids': large coordinated dungeon runs where groups of 10-40 players work together to complete highly complex PvE (player vs. environment) combat challenges. The app has a working user system and a database for user and team information. It allows for role assignment, and communicates with Blizzard's WoW profile API to get information on the players in each team.
